# DO NOT USE THIS!!! This was only some dirty workaround when modding was not a thing in Mordhau


# Taki Random Spawn System for Mordhau
### Easy to use Random Spawn System for Custom/Modded Mordhau Map Creators. You can set a range with a Sphere around a SpawnPoint. If somebody stays inside this Sphere the Spawn Controller will check for another SpawnPoint.

# ! IMPORTANT NOTE !
## Do not rename/move the folder structure or any files before the import process has finished successfully. And also afterwards, only do such stuff in the UE4 ContentBrowser!




> **1.** Download the newest version of this [**\> HERE <**](https://github.com/WaGi-Coding/TakiRandomSpawnForMordhau/releases)


> **2.** Unpack **`TakiUtility.zip`** into **`\Content\`** of your project (in windows explorer WHILE UE is closed) so after that you'll have **`\Content\Mordhau\Maps\TakiUtility\`** containing TakiSpawnController.uasset & TakiSpawnPoint.uasset. Aswell you should have **`\Content\Mordhau\Blueprints\Characters\BP_MordhauCharacter.uasset`** (thats not included in the old version for UE 4.21 since old ploucontent-pack contained it, the new one does not, so i've to share this aswell)

> **3.** Open your Project and open your Maps LevelBlueprint

> **4.** Drag **`TakiSpawnController`** into the LevelBlueprint and connect the Event BeginPlay with it.

## Thats it!

PS: When you plan to share your map, share the blueprints together inside your map folder. So after importing it while editor is closed, you create a folder called like you will save/share it then in UE Content Browser. Like `Content\Mordhau\Maps\MySickMap`. YOU STILL LEAVE THE LEVEL ITSELF IN CONTENT ROOT! Move the 2 Blueprints from `Content\Mordhau\Maps\TakiUtility\...` into your new created `Content\Mordhau\Maps\MySickMap` folder. For sure after cooking you also need the cooked Blueprints in your game-maps-folder `\steamapps\common\Mordhau\Mordhau\Content\Mordhau\Maps\MySickMap`. You can keep the normal original structure, but when more people do this, they will maybe override it with a newer/older version which cause problems. So i prefer to move the scripts AFTER IMPORTING to prevent this.


REMEMBER: You need the cooked blueprints in same location as in your editor on your client then!

You maybe want to adjust the Spheres Radius.
You can find that in the Component Hierachy

Aswell you can now switch between Box or Sphere for the detection
